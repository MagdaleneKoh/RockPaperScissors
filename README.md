# RockPaperScissors

This is a rock-paper-scissors game that's played completely from the console. 

In building this game, I will be able to practice building functions and inputs, and returning results of the player winning or losing the round.

Pseudocoding and planning would be the first steps towards building this game, followed by actual coding and debugging.
